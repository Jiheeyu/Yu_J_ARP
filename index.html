                        Yeah, that's not funny, that's not
                        the kind of humor we do on this
                        show.

                        Sorry. It's been a rough few
                        months, Murray. I mean, after my
                        mother died, the police came to
                        question me at her funeral. Who
                        does that?

                        MURRAY FRANKLIN
                        Oh really? Were you a suspect?
                        The audience laughs.

                        JOKER
                        Very funny, Murray. No, they came
                        because I killed those three Wall
                        Street guys.
